# TwitterTask
 Final project of the course Development of Social Applications at the HTW Berlin

The goal of this project is to practice the basics of programming Spark applications using Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). 

The project is divided into 3 parts: 
The first part should serve as a Spark tutorial, where basic RDD operations should be applied to already known, simple problems. 
The second part should calculate various statistics for a small Twitter dataset. The Twitter dataset contains tweets of our members of the Bundestag from the beginning of January to the end of May. 
In the last part, the page rank algorithm will be implemented using Spark. This can then be applied to a small dataset scraped from Wikipedia on the topic of Star Wars.
